# Project Title: Mauritania Data Dashboard

## Overview

The **Mauritania Data Dashboard** is a responsive web application designed to visualize and analyze various datasets related to regions and cities in Mauritania. It features an interactive map, data filtering options, and compact data visualizations to provide insights into demographic, health, and geographical data. The application is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the back end, while the front end is developed using modern web technologies to ensure responsiveness and user engagement.

## Current Status

The **front end** of the project is **fully functional** and ready for use, while the **back end** is currently being developed. Users can run the front-end application locally and explore the available features. The back end will be integrated soon, and AI implementation is also planned for future updates.

## Front-End Technologies

The front end is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications. It provides a robust structure for routing and improves SEO through server-side rendering.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling the creation of reusable UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid design and customization of the user interface, ensuring a clean and modern look.
- **Mapbox**: A mapping library used for displaying interactive maps and geographical data.

## Features

- **Responsive Dashboard Layout**: A user-friendly interface that includes a map for data visualization, a sidebar for filtering options, and a top navigation bar.
- **Interactive Map**: Users can explore data across different regions of Mauritania with zoom controls and tooltips for detailed information.
- **Data Filters**: A collapsible sidebar enables users to filter data by type, region, and time range.
- **Data Visualization Panels**: Compact charts and graphs to show trends and insights based on selected filters.
- **Future AI Integration**: The architecture is designed to support future enhancements using artificial intelligence.
